# Artlogic Backend Python Task

**Time spent on the Python tasks:** `3hrs`

The easiest way to test the code would be to **copy** the `tasks.py` and **paste** into an online compiler like this one: [Python Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) 

Alternatively run it in a terminal following the steps below:

- `git clone git@github.com:code-karma/artlogic-python.git`
- `cd artlogic-python`
- `python tasks.py`

### Notes:

It is worth mentioning that the solution would be much more elegant in OOP Python with access to the MySql DB and a data framework. It would require a couple of lines of code. Also, if I used PHP this would take no more than 1 hour to complete.
